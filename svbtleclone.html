            <h2>Looking At Hue Connected Lights</h2>

            <h3 class="articleauthor">TYLER HAYES</h3>

            <p>There’s not really a problem with light bulbs as they currently stand and yet after a short time with 3 connected Hue lights from Philips, it’s hard to imagine not having them.</p>

            <p>The ability to change colors is one thing, but the true brilliance is simply being able to turn lights on or off from anywhere.</p>

            <p>Having lights that connect to the internet, via a hub, is a glimpse into the connected home.</p>

            <p>Installing the lights is like any other light bulb, except the hub which gets hardwired into the router. The hub is the connecting piece and what ties all the bulbs or other Hue pieces together. It’s how you’re able to group different lights, or control them all.</p>

            <p>In hindsight it’s very simple, but every time you connect a new mobile app to control the bulbs in a new way, you are typically required to press the hub button as a way to allow permission. It’s similar to the experience of using Sonos speakers, another simple wireless (speaker) solution.</p>
